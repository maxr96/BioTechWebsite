                                <h3>UTI</h3>
                                <p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that mainly affects the lower part of
                                    the urinary system: bladder, urethra and sometimes even the kidneys. Typical
                                    symptoms are a lasting need to urinate, together with a burning pain when doing so.
                                    However, frequently the affected person can urinate only in small amounts, which
                                    eventually becomes very frustrating. Women, who have a higher chance to contract
                                    UTIs due to their physiology (closeness of urethra and anus), additionally suffer
                                    from pelvic pain. A UTI is a tedious and distressing disease.
                                </p>
                                <p> It is estimated that 90% of UTIs are caused by E. coli bacteria. These bacteria
                                    reside in the bowel tract, amongst others, and are found in feces. Therefore, bad
                                    hygiene, sexual activity and the use of certain birth control types are considered
                                    risk factors and favor the contraction of a UTI. </p>
                                <p> Because a UTI can spread to the kidneys, and in some cases become life threatening,
                                    it is very commonly treated with antibiotics. However, roughly 25% of women affected
                                    by a UTI get the disease again within the following year. This high chance of
                                    recurrence and the possibility to develop a chronic UTI makes the administration of
                                    antibiotics less effective and is a dangerous strategy, since the patient will
                                    develop an antibiotic resistance. Hence alternative treatments for UTI are
                                    necessary.

                                <h3>Alternative treatment</h3>
                                <h4>Home remedies</h4>
                                <h5>Good Hydration</h5>
                                <p>Prevents and treats UTIs. On average a good hydration requires at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. This amount of water will remove waste from the body and provide it with important nutrients and electrolytes. Moreover, drinking enough water will dilute the urine and accelerates its journey through the system. This makes it difficult for bacteria to access the cells within the urinary organs making the infection less likely. 
                                </p>
                                <h5>Urinating as soon as this is needed </h5>
                                <p>Continuous urination will reduce the amount of bacteria the urine by clearing them out of urinary tract. This will decrease the risk of bacteria accessing and fixing themselves to the urinary tract. </p>
                                <h5>Cranberry juice and capsules</h5>
                                <p>Cranberry has properties that may hinder E.coli cells to attach to cells within the urinary tract. Cranberry Juice is one of the most accepted natural treatments for UTIs. It carries antioxidants including polyphenols which hold antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. A recommended amount of 400 ml. with at least 25 percent cranberry juice a day will prevent/treat UTIs. Cranberry capsules/supplements are an alternative for avoiding the high levels of sugar and unpleasant taste of the cranberry juice.</p>
                                <h5>Blueberries</h5>
                                <p>Have similar properties to cranberry, keeping bad bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract organs</p>
                                <h5>Vitamin C</h5>
                                <p>Acidifies urine, hindering the growth of bacteria. Dr. Suzanne Salamon from the Harvard Medical School recommends taking Vitamin C supplements of 500 to 1000 mg on a daily basis or eating foods rich in Vitamin C such as oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, and green vegetables.
