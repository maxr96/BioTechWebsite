                            <p>Gastrointestinal infections are viral, bacterial or parasitic infections that cause gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract involving both the stomach and the small intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Dehydration is the main danger of gastrointestinal infections, so rehydration is important, but most gastrointestinal infections are self-limited and resolve within a few days. However, in a healthcare setting and in specific populations (newborns/infants, immunocompromized patients or elderly populations), they are potentially serious. Rapid diagnosis, appropriate treatment and infection control measures are therefore particularly important in these contexts.                            </p>

                            <h4>Good Hydration</h4>
                            <p>Prevents and treats UTIs. On average a good hydration requires at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. This amount of water will remove waste from the body and provide it with important nutrients and electrolytes. Moreover, drinking enough water will dilute the urine and accelerates its journey through the system. This makes it difficult for bacteria to access the cells within the urinary organs making the infection less likely. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Urinating as soon as this is needed </h4>
                            <p>Continuous urination will reduce the amount of bacteria the urine by clearing them out of urinary tract. This will decrease the risk of bacteria accessing and fixing themselves to the urinary tract. </p>
                            <h4>Cranberry juice and capsules</h4>
                            <p>Cranberry has properties that may hinder E.coli cells to attach to cells within the urinary tract. Cranberry Juice is one of the most accepted natural treatments for UTIs. It carries antioxidants including polyphenols which hold antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. A recommended amount of 400 ml. with at least 25 percent cranberry juice a day will prevent/treat UTIs. Cranberry capsules/supplements are an alternative for avoiding the high levels of sugar and unpleasant taste of the cranberry juice.</p>
                            <h4>Blueberries</h4>
                            <p>Have similar properties to cranberry, keeping bad bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract organs</p>
                            <h4>Vitamin C</h4>
                            <p>Acidifies urine, hindering the growth of bacteria. Dr. Suzanne Salamon from the Harvard Medical School recommends taking Vitamin C supplements of 500 to 1000 mg on a daily basis or eating foods rich in Vitamin C such as oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, and green vegetables.

                            <p>The World Health Organization has defined probiotics as “useful living microorganisms
                                that have a positive effect on the health and physiology of a person when taken in
                                sufficient quantities.”. Probiotics for prevention and infection treatments should
                                have Lactobacillus species. Probiotics act against bad bacteria by acidifying to the
                                vaginal mucosal surface, this inhibits that harmful bacteria adhere. Further,
                                probiotics generate vitamins and immunomodulators. They restore back and fortify the
                                natural bacterial environments preventing from recurrent UTIs.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Oral Probiotics</h4>
                            <p> Are good for regulation of the vaginal flora and are particularly good for chronic
                                UTIs. The advantage of oral over the vaginal application (suppository) is that type
                                of administration is more comfortable for patients.
                                <h4>Vaginal Probiotics</h4>
                                <p> Intravaginal suppository probiotics are small devices with form of a tampon
                                    which have to get inserted into the vagina. It is important to carefully follow
                                    the administration instructions since its important keeping this friendly
                                    bacteria alive.

                            <p>Women who experience recurrent UTIs are good candidates for a UTI vaccine. Cystitis, or bladder infection, amounts to about 90 percent of all UTIs. Between 20 and 30 percent of these women experience a recurrence within 3 or 4 months. Recurrent UTIs result in protracted discomfort and pain and contribute to antibiotic resistance because women who have them often take antibiotics during much of the year. </p>
                            <h4>FimCH Vaccine  </h4>
                            <p>The FimCH vaccine is a specific-antigen vaccine that consists of the FimH bacterial adhesion protein. The FimH protein is necessary for E. coli to colonize the urinary tract. The vaccine induces an immune response to target the FimH protein.</p>
                            <p>According to media reports, during Sequoia’s phase I trials of the FimCH vaccine, the vaccine was well-tolerated and induced a strong immune response. More specifically, 67 women received the vaccine. Of these women, 30 had a history of recurrent UTI that lasted 2 years. Notably, the results of these phase I clinical trials have not been formally published in the literature.</p>
                            <h4>ExPEC4V Vaccine</h4>
                            <p>GlycoVaxyn and Janssen Pharmaceuticals have also been working on another UTI vaccine called ExPEC4V, which is a tetravalent E. coli bioconjugate vaccine candidate.</p>
                            <p>In total, 93 women received the vaccine and 95 women received a placebo. Participants were between 18 and 70 years old and had a history of recurrent UTIs. The vaccine was well-tolerated by recipients. Furthermore, the vaccine induced a significant immune response, and women who received the vaccine had far fewer UTIs caused by E. coli.
                            </p>
